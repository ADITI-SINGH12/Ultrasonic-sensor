# Ultrasonic-sensor
Working on Arduino and Proteus.
here ultrasonic sensor used in case of virtual terminology to see the output where as in lcd_ultrasonic I used lcd 16 into 2 to display distances.
Ultrasonic Sensor measures the distance between to the target by measuring the time between emission and reception. 
This Sensor Is An Air Intelligent Sensor, Which Will Use The Phenomenon Of Wave Propagation In The Air To Measure Physical Or Chemical Variables.
These Sensors Can Be Used To Measure Wind Speed And Speed Through Air Or Water.
